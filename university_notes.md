# Sovann's Github University Notes

>Check your Wunderlist for the monthly objectives (the CEO of Microsoft uses it, I'm such a bandwagon)
>These notes are basically me picking and choosing the things I think are most important

## Interviews

>For interviews, focus on the C++ language. Time to become proficent in C++...

## Misc

>The following is a good reminder for keeping the knowledge you learn: 
[Retaining Computer Science Knowledge](https://startupnextdoor.com/retaining-computer-science-knowledge/)

**Note on flashcards:** The first time you recognize you know the answer, don't mark it as known. You have to see the
same card and answer it several times correctly before you really know it. Repetition will put that knowledge deeper in
your brain.

## The Daily Plan

Some subjects take one day, and some will take multiple days. Some are just learning with nothing to implement.

Each day I take one subject from the list below, watch videos about that subject, and write an implementation in:
- C - using structs and functions that take a struct * and something else as args.
- C++ - without using built-in types
- C++ - using built-in types, like STL's std::list for a linked list
- Python - using built-in types (to keep practicing Python)
- and write tests to ensure I'm doing it right, sometimes just using simple assert() statements
- You may do Java or something else, this is just my thing.
